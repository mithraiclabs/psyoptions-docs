PsyOptions is an American style options protocol built on the Solana blockchain.
The core principles that have guided the architecture and development of the core protocol are flexibility and extensibility.
It is completely trustless. The core protocol makes no assumptions on how the options should be traded or priced.
Options are represented as SPL Tokens, which means they can be traded on any DEX that supports SPL Tokens.
