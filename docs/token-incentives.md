## Liquidity Mining
The PsyOptions liquidity mining program is focused on incentivizing market makers to 
provide liquidity on Serumâ€™s order books at the best possible prices. Those that 
price well and have orders filled will receive PSY tokens.

PsyOptions is a complimentary protocol to Serum, so it has no hooks into actions that Serum handles.
Beacuse of that, the PsyOptions Market Tracker will be used to monitor all Serum markets 
where the base currency is minted from the PsyOptions protocol (i.e. a PsyOptions option contract 
trading on Serum).

### Phase 1
Duration: about 3 months (13 weeks) after mainnet beta launch<br />
Total Supply: 2,000,000<br />
Weekly Reward Pool: ~153,846<br />

At the end of every week a snapshot will be taken from the PsyOptions Market Tracker. It 
will detail all contracts that trades on Serum within the week and 
attrbiute them to the address that posted the order. The tracker will aggregate 
the contract premiums each address sold and use that aggregate over the total premiums 
for all addresses that week to determine an addresses share of the _Weekly Reward Pool_.

For Example: 

| Address | Total Premiums | Share of Reward Pool |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| address_1 | USDC 500,000 | 66.6% | 
| address_2 | USDC 230,000 | 30.666% |
| address_3 | USDC 10,000 | 1.33% |
| address_4 | USDC 1,000 | 0.13% |
| address_5 | USDC 9,000 | 1.2% |
| Total | USDC 750,000 | 100% |
