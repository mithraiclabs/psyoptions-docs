## DeFi Thought Leaders
The initial team is filled with incredible engineers, but we are all retail traders. We have some ideas 
on where PsyOptions should go, but this is a community lead project. We're hoping we can lean on the 
community to contribute feedback, ideas, and incredible visions about what the next iteration of 
PsyOptions is.

[discord](https://discord.com/invite/MgDdJKgZJc) and express your interest in becoming a
