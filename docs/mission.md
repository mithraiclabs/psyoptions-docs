## Our Beginning

At the end of 2020, the founding contributors were looking to automate a yield generating, 
options trading strategy in TradFi. They called their brokerages to inquire about API access, 
but were immediately rejected. Fresh off the first Solana hackathon, it hit them. Why don't 
we build vanilla options into the Solana blockchain. Anyone and everyone would have API 
access inherintly built in, so they could automate whatever strategy they'd like.

PsyOptions was born out of necessity. We are democratizing access to products and resources 
typically restricted to TradFi encumbents.

## Our Mission

PsyOptions strives to be the most community oriented DeFi protocol. What knowledge we do not 
posess, we seek and reward those within the community that do. We are built by the community 
for the community.
