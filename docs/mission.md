## Our Beginning

At the end of 2020, the founding contributors were looking to automate a yield generating, 
options trading strategy in TradFi. They called their brokerages to inquire about API access, 
but were immediately rejected. Fresh off the first Solana hackathon, it hit them. Why don't 
we build vanilla options into the Solana blockchain. Anyone and everyone would have API 
access inherintly built in, so they could automate whatever strategy they'd like.

PsyOptions was born out of necessity. We are democratizing access to products and resources 
typically restricted to TradFi encumbents.

## Our Mission

PsyOptions aims to bring a TradFi feel to DeFi by building a decentralized, permissionless, and community-owned financial services platform. Our vision is to not only provide our users with a decentralized options trading platform, but to become the de facto on-chain financial services platform for DeFi users across the globe. Our initial options protocols are simply the first step along the path of building towards this goal.
